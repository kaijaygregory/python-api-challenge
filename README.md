# __Background__

The true power of data lies in its ability to answer fundamental questions. This project harnesses Python's capabilities with requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a key question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

# __Part 1: WeatherPy__

* Visualized weather data for 500+ cities using the OpenWeatherMap API and citipy.
* Explored relationships between weather variables and latitude.
* Created plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude.
* Computed linear regression for each relationship.
* Explaind findings.
* Described relationships observed in the data and interpretations from linear regression.

# __Part 2: VacationPy__

* Utilized weather data to plan future vacations using geoViews, Geoapify API, and Jupyter notebooks.
* Created a map with city points.
* Filtered ideal weather conditions.
* Found nearest hotels.
* Displayed hotel information on map.
